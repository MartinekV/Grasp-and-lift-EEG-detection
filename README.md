# Grasp-and-lift-EEG-detection

This project compares various machine-learning models in terms of viability for EEG lift-and-grasp kaggle competition,  which took place in 2015.  This competition challenged its participants to identify, when a hand is grasping, lifting or replacing an object using EEGdata taken from subjects performing those activities.
